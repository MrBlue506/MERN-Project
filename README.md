# MERN-Project
 
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### HomelyHub app using MERN Stack

HomelyHub is a platform that lets people find and book unique places to 
stay while traveling. Whether it's a cozy home or a fancy villa, or room, you 
can experience a personalized stay. Hosts can also earn money by sharing 
their spaces. so, Explore the world with HomelyHub for a unique and comfy 
adventure!" 

 
Architecture: 
 
The HomelyHub project using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) 
stack is designed to replicate the core functionalities of the Airbnb platform. The 
architecture comprises a MongoDB database to store property and user data, while 
Express.js handles server-side logic and API endpoints. React is employed for building 
the user interface, providing a dynamic and responsive experience for property listings 
and bookings. Node.js serves as the runtime environment for server-side execution, 
ensuring seamless communication between the front and back ends. The project 
follows a modular structure, with components for user authentication, property search, 
and booking features. Redux is integrated for efficient state management, enabling a 
smooth flow of data within the application. Additionally, the project employs RESTful 
API principles to facilitate communication between the client and server, ensuring a 
scalable and maintainable codebase.  
 
 
Features: 
 
 
• User Authentication: Allow users to sign up, login, and manage their profiles 
i.e., update users profile and password. 
 
• Search and Filters: Implement a search feature with filters to enable users to 
easily find properties based on location, dates, pricing, and amenities, enhancing 
the overall user experience. 
 
• View Listings: Users can view detailed information about each 
accommodation, including photos, descriptions, amenities. 
 
• Property Listings: Allow property owners to list their accommodations,

• Booking System: Develop a booking system that allows users to select desired 
dates, view pricing, and confirm reservations, with real-time updates on 
availability and booking status. 
 
• User Profiles: Implement user profiles where individuals can manage their 
bookings, update personal information, and track their property listing activity. 
 
• Payment Integration: Integrate a secure payment gateway to handle 
transactions, allowing users to make reservations and property owners to receive 
payments seamlessly. 
 
• Responsive Design: Ensure a responsive and visually appealing design that 
adapts to various devices, providing a consistent and user-friendly experience
